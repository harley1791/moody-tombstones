I'm going to put a link on here anyone
 interested it shows you pictures of the
 third party open source licenses open source
 licenses then I have all that crap in the 
privacy where you European union and all that
 then I've got those certificates that I have 
on this phone that are I hate used word hacker
 on here but has been used by hacker for over
 3 years multiple phones computers tablets
 ruined credit cards and I finally found out
 who it was and it happens to be my ex-wife
 but I really don't want to get her in trouble
 because of the kids I just want my damn 
phones back so I got this Moto G7 power and 
I've got a Samsung s 20 that if anybody can
 help me with where she can't send me a text
 and hacked it again and keep her from doing
 it I will be forever grateful.

She does all that stuff on my phone with a
 couple of little text messages because I'm 
too stupid to turn the auto receive off.surely 
to God somebody out there can send me a
 couple of text messages and correct this 
thing.
